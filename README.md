# NOTE! This code has been upgraded and the current release no longer supports installation in AWS
If you wish to deploy in AWS, use [this](https://github.com/CiscoSecurity/tr-05-serverless-is-it-phishing/releases/tag/v1.0.1) previous release.

# IsItPhishing Relay (Cisco Hosted)

Concrete Relay implementation using
[IsItPhishing](https://isitphishing.ai/)
as a third-party Cyber Threat Intelligence service provider.

The Relay itself is just a simple application written in Python that can be
easily packaged and deployed. This relay is now Cisco Hosted and no longer requires AWS Lambda.

## Rationale

- We need an application that will translate API requests from SecureX Threat Response to the third-party integration, and vice versa. 
- We need an application that can be completely self contained within a virtualized container using Docker.  

## Testing (Optional)

Open the code folder in your terminal.
```
cd code
```

If you want to test the application you have to install a couple of extra
dependencies from the [Pipfile](code/Pipfile) file:
```
pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade pipenv && pipenv install --dev
```

You can perform two kinds of testing:

- Run static code analysis checking for any semantic discrepancies and
[PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) compliance:

  `flake8 .`

- Run the suite of unit tests and measure the code coverage:

  `coverage run --source api/ -m pytest --verbose tests/unit/ && coverage report`

If you want to test the live Lambda you may use any HTTP client (e.g. Postman),
just make sure to send requests to your Lambda's `URL` with the `Authorization`
header set to `Bearer <JWT>`.

**NOTE.** If you need input data for testing purposes you can use data from the
[observables.json](observables.json) file.

### Building the Docker Container
In order to build the application, we need to use a `Dockerfile`.  

 1. Open a terminal.  Build the container image using the `docker build` command.

```
docker build -t tr-05-is-it-phishing .
```

 2. Once the container is built, and an image is successfully created, start your container using the `docker run` command and specify the name of the image we have just created.  By default, the container will listen for HTTP requests using port 9090.

```
docker run -dp 9090:9090 --name tr-05-is-it-phishing tr-05-is-it-phishing
```

 3. Watch the container logs to ensure it starts correctly.

```
docker logs tr-05-is-it-phishing
```

 4. Once the container has started correctly, open your web browser to http://localhost:9090.  You should see a response from the container.

```
curl http://localhost:9090
```

## Implementation Details

This application was developed and tested under Python version 3.9.

### Implemented Relay Endpoints

- `POST /health`
  - Verifies the Authorization Bearer JWT and decodes it to restore the
  original credentials.
  - Authenticates to the underlying external service to check that the provided
  credentials are valid and the service is available at the moment.

- `POST /deliberate/observables`
  - Accepts a list of observables and filters out unsupported ones.
  - Verifies the Authorization Bearer JWT and decodes it to restore the
  original credentials.
  - Makes a series of requests to the underlying external service to query for
  some cyber threat intelligence data on each supported observable.
  - Maps the fetched data into appropriate CTIM entities.
  - Returns a list per each of the following CTIM entities (if any extracted):
    - `Verdict`.

- `POST /observe/observables`
  - Accepts a list of observables and filters out unsupported ones.
  - Verifies the Authorization Bearer JWT and decodes it to restore the
  original credentials.
  - Makes a series of requests to the underlying external service to query for
  some cyber threat intelligence data on each supported observable.
  - Maps the fetched data into appropriate CTIM entities.
  - Returns a list per each of the following CTIM entities (if any extracted):
    - `Judgement`,
    - `Verdict`.

- `POST /version`
  - Returns the current version of the application.

### Supported Types of Observables

- `url`

### CTIM Mapping Specifics

Each response from IsItPhishing API for URLs generates the following CTIM entities:
- `Verdict` and `Judgement` based on the value of `status` with the following mapping:

    | `status` | `disposition_name`|
    | -------- | ----------- |
    | PHISHING | Malicious |
    | SPAM | Suspicious |
    | TIMEOUT | Unknown |
    | NOT_EXPLORED | Unknown |
    | UNKNOWN | Unknown |
